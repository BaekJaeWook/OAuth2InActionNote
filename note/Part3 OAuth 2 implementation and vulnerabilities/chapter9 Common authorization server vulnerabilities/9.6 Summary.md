There are many responsibilities when securing an authorization server, as it serves as the [linchpin](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/linchpin) of the OAuth security ecosystem.

* **Burn the authorization code once it’s been used**.
* **Exact matching** is the ONLY safe validation method for `redirect_uri` that the authorization server should adopt.
* Implementing the OAuth core specification verbatim might lead us to have the authorization server acting as an open redirector. If this is a properly monitored redirector, this is fine, but it might pose some threats if implemented naively.
* Be mindful of information that can leak through fragments or `Referer` headers during error reporting.

Now that we’ve taken a look at how to secure all three major parts of the OAuth ecosystem, let’s take a look at securing the most essential element in any OAuth transaction: the OAuth token.
