Figure 9.2 :framed_picture: `Authorization code grant flow forged`

It turns out that the [OAuth core specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) gives us a solution to this problem in section 4.1.3:

> **The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once**. **If an authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on that authorization code**.
