*We’ve also seen that without the knowledge of the client_secret, an attacker can’t achieve too much because the secret is needed in order to trade the authorization code for an access token*. **This continues to hold true only if the authorization server follows section 4.1.3 of the OAuth core specification, in particular**:

> **:key:ensure that the “redirect_uri” parameter is present if the “redirect_uri” parameter was included in the initial authorization request as described in Section 4.1.1, and if included ensure that their values are identical.:key:**

**Let’s assume an authorization server doesn’t implement this part of the specification and see what can go wrong**.

**As we’ve said, all the attacker has in their hands is an authorization code**. They don’t have any knowledge of the `client_secret` for the client that the authorization code is bound to, so theoretically they can’t achieve anything. **If the authorization server doesn’t implement this check, this still represents a problem**. **But before we dig into this, let’s review how the attacker was able to steal the authorization code in the first place**. All the techniques we’ve seen used to steal the authorization code (both in this chapter and in chapter 7) were related to some sort of **`redirect_uri` manipulation**. This was achieved because of the OAuth client’s poor choice of the registered `redirect_uri` or too loose of an authorization server `redirect_uri` validation algorithm. In both cases, the registered `redirect_uri` didn’t exactly match the one provided in the OAuth request. Nevertheless, the attacker hijacked the authorization code though a maliciously crafted URI.

**Now what an attacker can do is to present this hijacked authorization code to the OAuth callback of the victim’s OAuth client**. At this point, the client will proceed and try to trade the authorization code for an access token, presenting valid client credentials to the authorization server. The authorization code is bound to the correct OAuth client (see figure 9.4:framed_picture:).

**The result is that the attacker is able to successfully consume the hijacked authorization code and steal the protected resource of a target victim**.

**Let’s see how we can fix this in our code base**. :book:

**When the OAuth client presents the hijacked authorization code to the authorization server, the authorization server will now ensure that the `redirect_uri` presented in the initial authorization request will match the one presented in the token request**. Since the client isn’t expecting to send anyone to the attacker’s site, these values will never match and the attack fails. Having this simple check in place is extremely important and can negate many common attacks on the authorization code grant. Without this added check, there are several risks known to have been exploited in the wild.
