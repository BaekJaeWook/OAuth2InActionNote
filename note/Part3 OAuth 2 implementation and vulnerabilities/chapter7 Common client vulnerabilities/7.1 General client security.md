**The OAuth client has a few things that it needs to protect**. **If it has a client secret, it needs to make sure that this is stored in a place that is not easily accessible to outside parties**. **As it collects access tokens and refresh tokens, it likewise needs to make sure that these aren’t made available to components outside the client software itself and the other OAuth entities that it interacts with**. The client also needs to be careful that these secrets aren’t accidentally placed into audit logs or other ledgers where a third party could later surreptitiously look for them. This is all fairly straightforward security practice, and its implementation varies depending on the platform of the client software itself.

**However, outside of simple theft of information from a storage system, OAuth clients can still be vulnerable in a number of ways**. One of the most common mistakes is to use OAuth as an authentication protocol without taking any extra precautions, and this is such a broad issue that we’ve dedicated much of chapter 13 to its discussion. There you’ll encounter some issues such as the “confused deputy problem” and other authentication-related security issues. One of the worst results of a security breach to an OAuth client is to leak the resource owner’s authorization codes or access tokens through sloppy implementation of the OAuth protocol. On top of the damage caused to the resource owner, this can indeed generate some kind of uncertainty around the client application with significant repercussions on the use of the product with substantial reputational and/or financial loss for the company behind the OAuth client. **There are many security threats that a person implementing an OAuth client should guard against, and we’re going to discuss those one by one in the following sections**.
