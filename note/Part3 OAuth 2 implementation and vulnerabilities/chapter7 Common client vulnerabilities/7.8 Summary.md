**OAuth is a well-designed protocol, but to avoid security pitfalls and common mistakes the implementer needs to understand all its details**. In this chapter, we’ve seen how it’s relatively easy to steal an authorization code or an access token from an OAuth client that didn’t pay close attention to registering its `redirect_uri`. In some situations, the attacker is also able to maliciously trade the stolen authorization code with an access token or to perform a sort of CSRF attack using the authorization code.

* Use the **state parameter** as suggested in the specification (even if it isn’t mandatory).
* **Understand and carefully choose the correct grant (flow)** your application needs to use.
* Native applications shouldn’t use the implicit flow, as it’s intended for in-browser clients.
* Native clients can’t protect a client_secret unless it’s configured at runtime as in the dynamic registration case.
* **The registered `redirect_uri` must be as specific as it can be**.
* **Do NOT pass the access_token as a URI parameter if you can avoid it**.

Now that we’ve locked down our clients, let’s take a look at a few of the ways that we can protect our protected resources.
