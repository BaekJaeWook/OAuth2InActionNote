**If the attacker hijacked the authorization code, can they “steal” anything, such as the resource owner’s personal information as email, contact information, and so on?** **Not quite yet. Remember that the authorization code is still an intermediate step between the OAuth client and the access token, which is the final goal of the attacker**. To trade the authorization code for an access token, the client_secret is needed, and this is something that must be closely protected. But if the client is a public client, it will have no client secret and therefore the authorization code can be used by anyone. With a confidential client, an attacker can either try to maliciously obtain the client secret, as seen in section 7.2, or attempt to trick the OAuth client into performing a sort of CSRF similar to the one we have seen in section 7.1. We’re going to describe the latter case in chapter 9 and view its effects there.
