**Protected resources are vulnerable in a number of ways, the first and most obvious being that access tokens can leak, giving an attacker data about protected resources**. This can happen via token hijacking, as seen in the previous chapter, or because the token has weak [entropy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/entropy) or an overly wide scope. **Another issue related to protected resources is that the endpoints can be vulnerable to [cross-site scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5l9lSnNMxg) (XSS) attacks**. Indeed, if the resource server chooses to support access_token as a URI parameter, the attacker can forge a URI containing the XSS attack and then use social engineering to trick a victim into following that link. This can be as simple as a blog post with a review of the application, inviting people to try it out. When someone clicks on that link, the malicious JavaScript is then executed.
