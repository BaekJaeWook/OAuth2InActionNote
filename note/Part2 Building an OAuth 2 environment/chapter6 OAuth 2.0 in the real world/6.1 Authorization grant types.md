**In OAuth 1.0, there was only one method for getting an access token that all clients had to use**. *It was designed to be as general purpose as possible, attempting to [cater to](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cater-for-sb-sth) a wide variety of deployment options. As a consequence, the protocol was not particularly well suited to any use case*. Web applications needed to deal with request tokens that were intended for native applications to poll for state changes, native applications needed to deal with consumer secrets that were intended to protect web applications, and everybody had to deal with a customized signature mechanism. It worked well enough to cement OAuth as a powerful and foundational technology, but it left a lot to be desired.

**When OAuth 2.0 was being developed, the working group made a distinct decision to treat the core protocol as a framework instead of a single protocol**. *By keeping the core concepts of the protocol solid and allowing extensions in specific areas, OAuth 2.0 can be applied in many different ways*. Although it has been argued that the second version of any system will turn into an abstract framework, in OAuth’s case the abstractions have helped immensely in extending its applicability and usefulness.

**One of the key areas that OAuth 2.0 can vary is that of the authorization grant, colloquially known as the OAuth flow**. As we hinted at in previous chapters, the authorization code grant type is just one of several different ways that an OAuth client can get a token from an authorization server. Since we’ve covered the authorization code grant in great detail already, we’ll be looking at the other primary options here in this section.

### Implicit grant type

**One key aspect of the different steps in the *authorization code flow* is that it keeps information separate between different components**. This way, the browser doesn’t learn things that only the client should know about, and the client doesn’t get to see the state of the browser, and so on. **But what if we were to put the client inside the browser (see figure 6.1)?**

**This is what happens with a JavaScript application running completely inside the browser. The client then can’t keep any secrets from the browser, which has full insight into the client’s execution**. *In this case, there is no real benefit in passing the authorization code through the browser to the client, only to have the client exchange that for a token because the extra layer of secrets isn’t protected against anyone involved*.

**The implicit grant type does away with this extra secret and its [attendant](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/attendant) [round trip](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/round-trip) by returning the token directly from the authorization endpoint**. *The implicit grant type therefore uses only the front channel to communicate with the authorization server*. This flow is very useful for JavaScript applications embedded within websites that need to be able to perform an authorized, and potentially limited, session sharing across security domains.

**The implicit grant has :key:severe limitations:key: that need to be considered when approaching it**. **:one:First, there is no realistic way for a client using this flow to keep a client secret, since the secret will be made available to the browser itself**. *Since this flow uses only the authorization endpoint and not the token endpoint, this limitation does not affect its ability to function, as the client is never expected to authenticate at the authorization endpoint. However, the lack of any means of authenticating the client does impact the security profile of the grant type and it should be approached with caution*. **:two:Additionally, the implicit flow can’t be used to get a refresh token**. *Since in-browser applications are by nature short lived, lasting only the session length of the browser context that has loaded them, the usefulness of a refresh token would be very limited*. *Furthermore, unlike other grant types, the resource owner can be assumed to be still present in the browser and available to reauthorize the client if necessary*. Authorization servers are still able to apply Trust On First Use (TOFU) principles, allowing a reauthentic ation tobe a seamless user experience.

**The client sends its request to the authorization server’s authorization endpoint in the same manner as the authorization code flow, except that this time the response_ type parameter is set to token instead of code**. This signals the authorization server to generate a token immediately instead of generating an authorization code to be traded in for a token.

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://localhost:9001/authorize?response_type=token&scope=foo&client_ id=oauth-client-1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9000%2Fcallback&state=Lwt50DDQKUB8U7jtfLQCVGDL9cnmwHH1
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 444
Date: Fri, 31 Jul 2015 20:50:19 GMT
```

The client can do this by using a full-page redirect or by using an inline frame (iframe) inside the page itself. *Either way, the browser makes a request to the authorization server’s authorization endpoint. The resource owner authenticates themselves and authorizes the client in the same manner as the authorization code flow. However, this time the authorization server generates the token immediately and returns it by attaching it to the URI fragment of the response from the authorization endpoint*. Remember, since this is the front channel, the response to the client comes in the form of an HTTP redirect back to the client’s redirect URI.

```http
GET /callback#access_token=987tghjkiu6trfghjuytrghj&token_type=Bearer
HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Referer: http://localhost:9001/authorize?response_type=token&scope=foo&client_id=oauth-client-1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9000%2Fcallback&state=Lwt50DDQKUB8U7jtfLQCVGDL9cnmwHH1
```

The fragment portion of the URI isn’t usually sent back to the server, which means that the token value itself is available only inside the browser. Note, however, that this behavior does vary depending on the browser implementation and version.

### Client credentials grant type

**What if there is no explicit resource owner, or the resource owner is [indistinguishable](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/indistinguishable) from the client software itself?** This is a fairly common situation, in which there are back-end systems that need to communicate directly with each other and not necessarily on behalf of any one particular user. **With no user to delegate the authorization to the client, can we even do OAuth (see figure 6.2:framed_picture:)?**

**We can, by making use of the client credentials grant type that was added to OAuth 2.0 for this case**. *In the implicit flow, the client is pushed up into the browser and therefore into the front channel; in this flow, the resource owner is pushed down into the client and the user agent disappears from the picture*. *As a consequence, this flow makes exclusive use of the back channel, and the client acts on its own behalf (as its own resource owner) to get the access token from the token endpoint.*

**The client requests a token from the token endpoint as it would with the authorization code grant, except that this time it uses the client_credentials value for the grant_type parameter and doesn’t have an authorization code or other temporary credential to trade for the token. Instead, the client authenticates itself directly, and the authorization server issues an appropriate access token**. The client can also request specific scopes inside this call using the scope parameter, analogous to the scope parameter used at the authorization endpoint by the authorization code and implicit flows.

```http
POST /token
Host: localhost:9001
Accept: application/json
Content-type: application/x-www-form-encoded
Authorization: Basic b2F1dGgtY2xpZW50LTE6b2F1dGgtY2xpZW50LXNlY3JldC0x

grant_type=client_credentials&scope=foo%20bar
```

**The response from the authorization server is a normal OAuth token endpoint response: a JSON object containing the token information**. *The client credentials flow does not issue a refresh token because the client is assumed to be in the position of being able to request a new token for itself at any time without involving a separate resource owner, which renders the refresh token unnecessary in this context*.

```http
HTTP 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Jul 2015 21:19:03 GMT
Content-type: application/json

{
   "access_token":"987tghjkiu6trfghjuytrghj",
   "scope":"foo bar",
   "token_type":"Bearer"
}
```

*The client uses this access token in the same manner that it would an access token gathered through a different flow, and the protected resource doesn’t even necessarily have to know how the token was acquired*. *The tokens themselves will likely have different rights of access associated with them, depending on whether they were delegated by a user or requested directly by a client, but that kind of differentiation can be handled with an authorization policy engine that can tell those cases apart*. In other words, even though the tokens look the same coming through the front door of the resource server, they can still mean different things.

### Choosing the appropriate grant type

**With all of these choices for grant types, it may seem a [daunting](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/daunting) task to decide which one is the most appropriate for the task at hand**. **Thankfully, there are a few good [ground rules](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ground-rules) to follow that can guide you in the right direction (figure 6.6:framed_picture:).**
