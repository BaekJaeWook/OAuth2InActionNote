* Confidential clients can keep client secrets, but public clients can’t.

**Now that we’ve had a thorough look at how things are supposed to work in an OAuth ecosystem, we’re going to take a look at some of the things that can go wrong**. Read on to learn how to deal with vulnerabilities found in implementations and deployments of OAuth.
