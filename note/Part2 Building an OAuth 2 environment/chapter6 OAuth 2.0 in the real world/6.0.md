**So far in this book, we’ve covered OAuth 2.0 in a fairly [idealized](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/idealize) state**. All the applications look the same, all the resources look the same, and everybody does things the same way. Our extensive example in chapter 2 covered the authorization grant protocol, using a web application with a client secret. All of our exercises in chapters 3, 4, and 5 have made use of the same setup.

**Making simplifying assumptions like this is a good way to learn about the fundamentals of a system, but of course the applications we all build in the real world need to live in the real world with all of its variations**. OAuth 2.0 [anticipates](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/anticipate) these variations in several ways by allowing flexibility in the OAuth protocol in key places. In this chapter, we’ll look at some of those extension points in greater detail.
