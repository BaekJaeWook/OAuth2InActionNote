The problem of wanting to connect multiple disparate services is [hardly](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/hardly) new, and we could make a [compelling](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compelling) argument that it’s been around from the moment there was more than one network-connected service in the world.

***One approach*, popular in the enterprise space, is to *copy the user’s credentials and replay them on another service* (see figure 1.3:framed_picture:)**. In this case, the photo printer assumes that the user is using the same credentials at the printer that they’re using at the storage site. When the user logs in to the printer, the printer replays the user’s username and password at the storage site in order to gain access to the user’s account over there, pretending to be the user.

**This technique also exposes the user’s password to the client application, though inside a single security domain using a single set of credentials, this is likely to be happening anyway**. **However, the client is impersonating the user, and the protected resource *has no way to tell the difference between the resource owner and the impersonating client* because they’re using the same username and password in the same way**.

***But what if the two services occupied different security domains*, a likely scenario for our photo-printing example?** **We *can’t copy the password the user gave us to log into our application any longer, because it won’t work on the remote site***. Faced with this challenge, these [would-be](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/would-be) credential thieves could employ an [age-old](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/age-old) method for stealing something: **ask the user** (figure 1.4:framed_picture:).

**By now you’ve seen that replaying user passwords is bad**. **What if, instead, we gave the printing service universal access to all photos on the storage service on behalf of anyone it chose?** ***Another common approach* is to use a *developer key* (figure 1.5:framed_picture:) issued to the client, which uses this to call the protected resource directly**.

**In this approach, *the developer key acts as a kind of universal key that allows the client to impersonate any user that it chooses, probably through an API parameter***. **This has the benefit of not exposing the user’s credentials to the client, but at the cost of the client requiring a highly powerful credential**.

***Another possible approach* is to give users a *special password* (figure 1.6:framed_picture:) that’s only for sharing with third-party services**.

**Can’t we do better than this?**

**What if we were able to have this kind of limited credential, issued separately for each client and each user combination, to be used at a protected resource?** **We could then tie limited rights to each of these limited credentials**. **What if there were a network-based protocol that allowed the generation and secure distribution of these limited credentials across security boundaries in a way that’s both user-friendly and scalable to the internet as a whole?** **Now we’re starting to talk about something interesting**.
