**OAuth is a widely used security standard that enables secure access to protected resources in a fashion that’s friendly to web APIs**.

* OAuth is about **:key:how to get a token and how to use a token:key:**.
* OAuth is a **delegation protocol** that provides authorization across systems.
* OAuth replaces the password-sharing antipattern with a delegation protocol that’s [simultaneously](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/simultaneously) more secure and more usable.
* **OAuth is focused on solving a small set of problems and solving them well, which makes it a suitable component within larger security systems**.
