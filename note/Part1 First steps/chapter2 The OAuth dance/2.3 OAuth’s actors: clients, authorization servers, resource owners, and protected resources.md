*As we touched on in the last section, **there are four main actors in an OAuth system***: **:key:clients, resource owners, authorization servers, and protected resources:key: (figure 2.9:framed_picture:)**. Each of these components is responsible for different parts of the OAuth protocol, and all work together to make the OAuth protocol work.

**An OAuth client is a piece of software that attempts to access the protected resource on behalf of the resource owner, and it uses OAuth to obtain that access**. Thanks to the design of the OAuth protocol, the client is generally **the simplest component** in an OAuth system, and **its responsibilities are largely centered on obtaining tokens from the authorization server and using tokens at the protected resource**. **The client doesn’t have to understand the token, nor should it ever need to inspect the token’s contents**. Instead, the client uses the token as an opaque string. An OAuth client can be a web application, a native application, or even an in-browser JavaScript application, and we’ll cover the differences between these kinds of clients in chapter 6. *In our cloud-printing example, the printing service is the OAuth client*.

**An OAuth protected resource is available through an HTTP server and it requires an OAuth token to be accessed**. The protected resource needs to validate the tokens presented to it and determine whether and how to serve requests. In an OAuth architecture, the protected resource has the final say as to whether or not to [honor](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/honor) a token. *In our cloud-printing example, the photo-storage site is the protected resource*.

**A resource owner is the entity that has the authority to delegate access to the client**. Unlike other parts of the OAuth system, the resource owner isn’t a piece of software. In most cases, the resource owner is the person using the client software to access something they control. *For at least part of the process, the resource owner interacts with the authorization server using a web browser (more generally known as the user agent). The resource owner might also interact with the client using a web browser, as they do in our demonstration here, but that’s entirely dependent on the nature of the client*. *In our cloud-printing example, the resource owner is the end user who wants to print their photos*.

**An OAuth authorization server is an HTTP server that acts as the central component to an OAuth system**. The authorization server authenticates the resource owner and client, provides mechanisms for allowing resource owners to authorize clients, and issues tokens to the client. Some authorization servers also provide additional capabilities such as token introspection and remembering authorization decisions. *In our cloud-printing example, the photo-storage site runs its own [in-house](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/in-house) authorization server for its protected resources*.
