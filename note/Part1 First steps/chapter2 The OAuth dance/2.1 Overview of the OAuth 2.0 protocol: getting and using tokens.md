**OAuth is a complex security protocol, with different components sending pieces of information to each other in a precise balance [akin](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/akin) to a technological dance**. **But fundamentally, there are two major steps to an OAuth transaction: :key:issuing a token and using a token:key:**. The token represents the access that’s been delegated to the client and it plays a central role in every part of OAuth 2.0. Whereas the details of each step can vary based on several factors, **:key:the [canonical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/canonical) OAuth transaction consists of the following sequence of events:key:**:

1. **The Resource Owner indicates to the Client that they would like the Client to act on their behalf** (for example, “Go load my photos from that service so I can print them”).
2. **The Client requests authorization from the Resource Owner at the Authorization Server**.
3. **The Resource Owner grants authorization to the Client**.
4. **The Client receives a Token from the Authorization Server**.
5. **The Client presents the Token to the Protected Resource**.

Different deployments of the OAuth process can handle each of these steps in slightly different ways, often optimizing the process by collapsing several steps into a single action, but the core process remains essentially the same. **Next, we’ll look at the most canonical example of OAuth 2.0**.
